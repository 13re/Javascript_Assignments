// Readable Code

// shouldn't have to read multiple times to understand
// use proper punctuation/spacing like in English

/*
Ways to make code more readable:
    indenting
        when a child
        when inside a function, loop, or if block
    spacing (whitespace)
        between function arguments
        on each side of equals
        around operators
        before curly brackets
