Review: Functions

Function 
    // a way to re-execute blocks of code when writing programs, 
    without having to re-write the block of code entirely. 
    // Group code together, give it a name to call later.
    // Functions must first be declared + given a name (same way any variable is created),
    then follow it w/ a function definition.
        var sayHi = function(){
            anyCode
        };
    Any code could go inside that statement - one statement, multiple statements...
    
    If a function is only declared, nothing will happen. We must "call" the function
    in order for the program to execute the code inside the function. 
    To call a function, write: functionName();

    We can call functions whenever we want + however many times we want.
