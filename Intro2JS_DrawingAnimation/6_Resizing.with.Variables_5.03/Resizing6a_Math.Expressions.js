/* mathematical operators are used to calculate numbers + create expressions. 
    + addition 
    - subtraction 
    * multiplication 
    / division 
    % remainder

computer follows "order of operations" to compute results the same way each time. 
"PEMDAS" 
    Parenteses 
    Exponents 
    Multiplication 
    Division 
    Addition 
    Subtraction

Parenthese are only needed if an expression needs to be 
evaluated differently according to the order of operations.
