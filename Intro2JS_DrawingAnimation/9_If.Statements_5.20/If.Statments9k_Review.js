/* Review Notes

if statement
    tells the program to execute a block of code only if a condition is true
else statement
    executes some block of code in the case that the if condition is NOT true
conditionally 
    if this thing is true, then do X, but if this other thing is true, then do Y
    we can do things "conditionally" in our programs using "if statements" & "if/else statements" combined w/ "conditional expressions"
conditional expression / conditionals
    an expression that evaluates to either true or false
    uses comparison operators (comparisons) to evaluate whether true or false
boolean 
    a value that is either true or false (rather than a number or string)
    //
    var x = 0;
    text(x > 0, 200, 200); // Displays "true"
    //
    var isPositive = x > 0; // isPositive is storing a bloolean value
    text(isPositive, 200, 200); // Displays "true" 
comparison operators / comparisons
    === // Strict equality
    !== // Strict inequality
    > // Greater than
    >= // Greater than or equal
    < // Less than 
    <= // Less than or equal
assignent operator
    = // changes the value of the variable
logical operators
    && // and // requires 2 conditions are both true
    || // or // only requires one condition is true
