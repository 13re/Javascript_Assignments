/* NOTES
In the English language we have different parts of speech: 
    noun, adjective, preposition, verb... 
and then we have rules on how to put those parts of speech together. 
    "dog books my eats" makes no sense, 
    but "my dog eats books" does make sense. 

There are times when it makes sense to use a number & times when it doesn't. 
George Boole created Booleans which are numbers that mean "true" or "false". 
We have been using a Boolean called "if statements". if (boolean expression){do this}. 

A math expression is anything that evalauates to a number (ex: 2 + 3*4), 
but a boolean expression evaluates to a boolean. 
A good way to check is stick the word "is" in front, 
if it sounds like a question, then it's a boolean. Ex: 
    "is 4 < 5?" is boolean 
    "is 4 + 4" is not boolean
