// Looping - Review

/* NOTES

while loop
    // used when you don't know how many times to repeat code
    a way to repeat code until some condition is false
for loop
    // used when you know how many times to repeat code
    = similar to a while loop, but w/ more specialized syntax
    Programmers invented after repetition of doing the same 3 things:
        creating loop counter variables
        incrementing them by some amount
        checking that they're less than a value
infinite loop
    when the condition inside the parenthesis is always true within a loop
    Loops forever - program never knows when to stop. 

nested loops
    nesting a loop inside another loop
    Tells program "do this thing X many times, and for each time you do that, also do this other thing Y many times."
    ex: grids
