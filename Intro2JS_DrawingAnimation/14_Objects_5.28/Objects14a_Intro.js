// Intro to Objects

/* NOTES

Rather than create tons of variables on the same topic, create object

Object
    stores multiple pieces of information that are related

var friend = {
    age: 21, 
    eyes: "brown",
    likes: ["vegan food", "progress", "US"],
    isCool: true,
    birthplace: {
        city: "Sacramento",
        state: "California"
    }
}

use variableName.propertyKey to call objects
variableName.propertyKey.propertyKey2 
    objects inside objects
